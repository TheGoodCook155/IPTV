# IPTV
IPTV app example

/**
 * In order for this implementation to work you must set up the TEMP environment variable because the stream is stored locally in the %TEMP% folder and the file acts as a buffer
 * The Windows delimiter is used throughout the app so the app is not UNIX friendly
 * The piping is done through VLC (you must have VLC installed...Feel free to use another player(btw read the dev documentation) or build one by yourself)
 * Tested on WIN 10 and WIN 7 while using VPN
 * Parts of the app are censored due to obvious reasons
 * Use the code as an example on how to build IP TV stream app
 * There are a lot of improvements that can be done, and I may push some updates in the upcoming period
 *
 * Enjoy!
